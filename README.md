# React Challenge: React Portfolio - Zoran

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications.
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples.
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place to share your projects not only if you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that you can share your work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.

Now that you’ve completed multiple projects, your task is to create a portfolio, using your new React skills to help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies.

Just as you did in the module project, you’ll need to deploy this application to GitHub Pages. Follow the same instructions that you did for the project to create a build that you can deploy.
